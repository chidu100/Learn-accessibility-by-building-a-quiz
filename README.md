# Learn accessibility by building a quiz
 Created a mini step by step quiz from freecodecamp. the process was easy to learn and foloow.
 I edited the logo using the svg and giving it an aspect ratio to fit the nav. I also added a nav bar indicating the info, html, and css. 

# It was designed in:
1. HTML
2. CSS
