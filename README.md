# Learn accessibility by building a quiz
 I created a mini step-by-step quiz from freecodecamp. the process was easy to learn and follow.
 I edited the logo using the SVG, giving it an aspect ratio to fit the nav. I also added a nav bar indicating the info, HTML, and CSS. 

# It was designed with the following:
1. HTML
2. CSS
